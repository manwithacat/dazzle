## Personas (jobs)

- **Manager** (`manager`, stable≈`manager`, grounded) — desk `manager_desk` — role word in founder brief
- **Member** (`member`, stable≈`member`, grounded) — desk `member_desk` — role word in founder brief
- **Admin** (`admin`, stable≈`admin`, grounded) — desk `admin_desk` — role word in founder brief
- **User** (`user`, stable≈`user`, grounded) — desk `user_desk` — Generic system user

## Nouns (domain types)

- **Task** (grounded) owner≈`assigned_to` lifecycle: pending → assigned → in_progress → completed → blocked — appears in founder brief (source=capitalized_noun)
- **TaskComment** (grounded) owner≈`assigned_to` lifecycle: pending → assigned → in_progress → completed → blocked — appears in founder brief (source=article_noun)

## Rejected chrome (not domain)

`Administrator`, `Create`, `Demo`, `Level`, `List`, `Machine`, `Mix`, `Need`, `Pre`, `Progre`, `Require`, `Scenario`, `Several`, `Signal`, `Surface`, `Team`, `Test`, `Variant`, `Variou`, `completed`, `control`, `declared`, `development`, `discrete`, `implementation`, `intention`, `lifecycle`, `organization`, `review`, `right`, `specific`, `state`, `transition`, `urgent`, `work`, `workload`

## Desks

- **manager_desk** for `manager` (hypothesis) owner≈`assigned_to` — Job desk for Manager
- **member_desk** for `member` (hypothesis) owner≈`assigned_to` — Job desk for Member
- **admin_desk** for `admin` (hypothesis) owner≈`assigned_to` — Job desk for Admin
- **user_desk** for `user` (hypothesis) owner≈`assigned_to` — Job desk for User

## Demo spine (seed stories)

- `manager`: Manager has seeded Task rows for their desk (min_rows=1, entity≈Task)
- `member`: Member has seeded Task rows for their desk (min_rows=1, entity≈Task)
- `admin`: Admin has seeded Task rows for their desk (min_rows=1, entity≈Task)
- `user`: User has seeded Task rows for their desk (min_rows=1, entity≈Task)

## Open questions

- `q1`: Can a task have multiple teams, or just one?
- `q3`: Can a task have multiple tracks, or just one?
- `q4`: Can a member have multiple 7s, or just one?
- `q5`: Can a indicator have multiple overdues, or just one?
- `q6`: Can a progres have multiple workloads, or just one?

## Research notes

- Prefer knowledge concepts before inventing structure.
- Do not promote ungrounded nouns.
- Counter-prior bootstrap_pollution: this document is cognition draft, not DSL.
