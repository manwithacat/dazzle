## Domain Model

### Entity: User (Team Member)

Represents a team member who can be assigned tasks.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Business Rules |
|-------|------|----------|---------|----------------|
| `id` | UUID | Yes | Auto | Immutable primary key |
| `email` | String(200) | Yes | - | Unique, valid email format |
| `name` | String(100) | Yes | - | Display name |
| `role` | Enum | Yes | `member` | Access level: `admin`, `manager`, `member` |
| `department` | String(50) | No | - | Organizational unit |
| `avatar_url` | String(500) | No | - | Profile image URL |
| `is_active` | Boolean | Yes | `true` | Account status |
| `created_at` | DateTime | Yes | Auto | Immutable creation timestamp |

### Entity: Task

A discrete unit of work to be completed by a team member.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Business Rules |
|-------|------|----------|---------|----------------|
| `id` | UUID | Yes | Auto | Immutable primary key |
| `title` | String(200) | Yes | - | Short, actionable description |
| `description` | Text | No | - | Extended details, notes, context |
| `status` | Enum | Yes | `todo` | Workflow: `todo` → `in_progress` → `review` → `done` |
| `priority` | Enum | Yes | `medium` | Urgency: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `urgent` |
| `due_date` | Date | No | - | Target completion date |
| `assigned_to` | Ref(User) | No | - | Team member responsible for task |
| `created_by` | Ref(User) | No | - | Team member who created the task |
| `created_at` | DateTime | Yes | Auto | Immutable creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | DateTime | Yes | Auto | Last modification timestamp |

**State Machine (Status Transitions)**:
- `todo` → `in_progress`: Requires `assigned_to` to be set
- `in_progress` → `review`: Task ready for review
- `in_progress` → `todo`: Send back to backlog
- `review` → `done`: Approved and complete
- `review` → `in_progress`: Needs more work
- `done` → `todo`: Reopen (admin only)

**Invariants**:
- Urgent priority tasks must have a due date

**Access Control**:
- **Read**: Admin, Manager, or task is assigned to/created by current user
- **Write**: Admin, Manager, or task is assigned to current user

---

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario: Empty State
**Purpose**: Test onboarding flows with no data
- Admin starts at `/admin`
- Manager starts at `/team`
- Member starts at `/my-work`

### Scenario: Active Sprint
**Purpose**: Mid-sprint with tasks in various states
- Pre-populated with 5 team members and 7 tasks
- Mix of todo, in_progress, review, and done tasks
- Various priority levels to demonstrate attention signals

### Scenario: Overdue Crisis
**Purpose**: Test overdue task handling
- Several tasks with past due dates
- Tests warning indicators and overdue filtering

## User Interface Specification

### Surface: Task List

**Purpose**: View and manage all tasks
**Mode**: List with table layout

| Column | Source | Behavior |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Title | `task.title` | Primary identifier, clickable to detail |
| Status | `task.status` | Visual badge (color-coded) |
| Priority | `task.priority` | Visual badge (color-coded) |
| Due Date | `task.due_date` | Formatted date, highlight if overdue |
| Assigned To | `task.assigned_to.name` | User name with avatar |

**Persona Variants**:
- **Admin**: Sees all tasks, full management
- **Manager**: Sees all tasks, can assign to team
- **Member**: Sees only tasks assigned to or created by self

**Attention Signals**:
1. **Warning**: Task is overdue (`due_date < today AND status != done`)
2. **Notice**: Urgent task not started (`priority = urgent AND status = todo`)

---

### Surface: Task Create
