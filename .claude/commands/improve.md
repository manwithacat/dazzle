Single autonomous-improvement entrypoint for Dazzle. Each cycle: lock → local preflight → **CI badge snapshot** (repair if main is red) → **CodeQL open-alert snapshot** (remediate if high/error open) → signals → pick the highest-leverage lane → hand off to its playbook → record outcome → **self-schedule the next one-shot** (adaptive interval; durable chain, not a fixed `/loop` ticker).

Replaces /improve, /ux-cycle, /trial-cycle, /ux-converge. The lanes preserve those skills' bodies; the driver owns the scaffolding (lock, preflight, CI gate, CodeQL gate, signal bus, log, self-schedule).

ARGUMENTS: $ARGUMENTS

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty: driver picks the lane.
If `$ARGUMENTS` matches a lane name (`framework-ux` / `example-apps` / `trials` / `ux-converge` / `test-suite` / `hm-convergence`): force that lane. (`self-audit` forces the driver-level self-audit strategy; `capability-sweep` forces the capability-coverage sweep; `trial-signals` forces the TR-action drain strategy; `cimonitor` forces the CI-badge gate playbook even when main is green — re-check + report only unless red; `codeql` forces the CodeQL open-alert poll + remediate playbook.)
If `$ARGUMENTS` is `<lane> <strategy>`: force that lane and that sub-strategy.
If `$ARGUMENTS` is `--status`: emit a status report across all lanes and exit (no cycle).
If `$ARGUMENTS` is `--reset-budget`: write `0` to `.dazzle/improve-explore-count`, log the manual reset, and exit (no cycle). Operator escape hatch — use when the cap was reached but exploration should continue (e.g. after a large framework change that a release signal didn't capture).

## Lanes

| Lane | Targets | Backlog section | Playbook |
|------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| framework-ux | Dazzle's UI layer (templates, contracts, fitness walks) | `## Lane: framework-ux` | `improve/lanes/framework-ux.md` |
| example-apps | example apps (DSL gaps, lint, conformance, fidelity, visual) | `## Lane: example-apps` | `improve/lanes/example-apps.md` |
| trials | qualitative persona scenarios (trial.toml) | `## Lane: trials` | `improve/lanes/trials.md` |
| ux-converge | example apps with nonzero UX contract failures | `## Lane: ux-converge` | `improve/lanes/ux-converge.md` |
| test-suite | test-suite redundancy-cluster collapse (#1530) | `## Lane: test-suite` | `improve/lanes/test-suite.md` |
| hm-convergence | HM ownership floors + dual-locks + **hyperpart coherence investigate/drain** + taste (Tailwind drain complete) | `## Lane: hm-convergence` | `improve/lanes/hm-convergence.md` |

## State files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `dev_docs/improve-backlog.md` | All lanes' backlog tables, one `## Lane:` section each |
| `dev_docs/improve-log.md` | Append-only cycle log (single source of truth across all lanes) |
| `dev_docs/improve-backlog-archive.md` | Settled backlog rows (DONE/VERIFIED/CLEAN/RESOLVED/FILED-and-closed), moved by `scripts/improve_compact.py` |
| `dev_docs/improve-log-archive.md` | Cycle-log entries older than the last 25, moved by `scripts/improve_compact.py` |
| `.dazzle/improve.lock` | PID + timestamp; 15-min TTL |
| `.dazzle/improve-explore-count` | Single counter shared across all lanes' explore phases (cap 100) |
| `.dazzle/improve-schedule-state.json` | Last self-schedule decision (interval, reason, scheduler_create payload) |
| `.dazzle/signals/` | Cross-lane signal bus (existing `ux_cycle_signals` infrastructure) |

All gitignored (under `.dazzle/` or `dev_docs` local state as noted).

**State compaction.** The driver reads the backlog + log every cycle, so settled
material is pure context burn. When either working file exceeds **100 KB**, run
`python scripts/improve_compact.py` during Step 0d. The script is idempotent and
fail-safe (any row it can't parse unambiguously stays put); archives are append-only
and stay greppable. Archiving is a *driver housekeeping* action — it does not count
as a lane modifying DONE/VERIFIED rows. If a regression re-opens archived work,
copy the row back from the archive with status `REGRESSION`.

## Cycle

### Step 0a: Lock

1. If `.dazzle/improve.lock` exists and is < 15 min old → abort with the lock contents.
2. If older → delete as stale.
3. Create lock with `PID ISO-timestamp`.

### Step 0b: Preflight (always)

```bash
make test-ux-preflight
```

If red, **STOP and fix before continuing** — same rule as old /ux-cycle, applies to every lane now.

### Step 0c: CI badge gate (always)

Every cycle opens with a **snapshot** of the README badge workflow on `main` (not a long poll). Playbook: `improve/strategies/cimonitor.md` (thin wrapper around `.agents/skills/cimonitor/SKILL.md`).

```bash
gh run list --workflow ci.yml --branch main --limit 1 \
  --json status,conclusion,databaseId,url,displayTitle,updatedAt
```

| Snapshot | Driver action |
|----------|---------------|
| **Latest completed run `conclusion=failure` (or `cancelled` / `timed_out` that left the badge red)** | **This cycle is CI repair.** Do **not** pick a product/capability lane. Follow cimonitor: job breakdown → `gh run view <id> --log-failed` → fix root causes (including pre-existing) → commit → push → note follow-up. Log `lane: cimonitor`. `budget_consumed: 0`. Apply Step 3–4 (log, mark_run, release lock) and exit. Next `/improve` re-checks; if still red, repair again. |
| **Latest run `in_progress` / `queued`** | Record status + run URL in this cycle's log under **ci:**; **continue** the normal cycle (do not burn the whole cycle waiting — the 6m `/loop` re-checks). |
| **Latest completed run `conclusion=success`** | Record **ci: green** (run id) in the cycle log; continue. |
| **`gh` unavailable / auth failure / no runs** | Log **ci: unavailable** with the error; continue the cycle (local preflight already ran). Do not invent a green badge. |

**Hard preemption:** a red completed badge outranks REGRESSION backlog rows, CodeQL, self-audit, capability-sweep, TR drain, and explore for **this** cycle — a broken main badge is fleet-visible shipped-broken. Product REGRESSION work resumes on the next green (or when CI is unavailable and cannot be repaired here).

Forceable via `/improve cimonitor` (always run the snapshot; only enter repair mode when red, unless already mid-fix from a prior red cycle).

### Step 0c2: CodeQL / code-scanning gate (always when 0c did not claim repair)

Cheap poll of open GitHub code-scanning alerts. Playbook: `improve/strategies/codeql.md`.

```bash
gh api "repos/$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)/code-scanning/alerts" \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.state=="open")] | length'
```

| Snapshot | Driver action |
|----------|---------------|
| **Open alert(s) with `severity=error` or `security_severity_level` ∈ {`critical`,`high`}** | **This cycle is CodeQL repair.** Do **not** pick a product/capability lane. Follow `codeql.md`: list alerts → fix true positives (prefer root-cause + tests; model-pack for real barriers; dismiss only with reason) → commit → push. Log `lane: codeql`. `budget_consumed: 0`. Apply Step 3–4 and exit. |
| **Open alerts only warning/note** | Log `codeql: N open (low)`; **continue** unless ≥10 cycles since last `lane: codeql` and any remain open — then drain one. |
| **Zero open** | Log `codeql: clean`; continue. |
| **`gh` / API failure** | Log `codeql: unavailable`; continue. |

**Preemption order:** CI red (0c) > CodeQL high/error (0c2) > REGRESSION > self-audit > … Fleet-visible Security findings outrank product explore but never jump ahead of a red CI badge.

Forceable via `/improve codeql` (always poll; remediate any open alerts, not only high).

### Step 0d: Read signals

```python
from dazzle.cli.runtime_impl.ux_cycle_signals import since_last_run
signals = since_last_run(source="improve")
```

Categorise:
- `dazzle-updated` → **reset the explore budget**: write `0` to `.dazzle/improve-explore-count` and note the reset (with the release version) in this cycle's log entry. A published release means fresh explore territory — the cap is per-release, not per-lifetime. Also mark affected backlog rows for re-verification (delegated to each lane).
- `fix-deployed` → mark affected backlog rows for re-verification (delegated to each lane)
- `trial-friction` → bias next lane selection toward `framework-ux` (qualitative finding may need a contract)
- `ux-component-shipped` → bias toward `example-apps` (re-verify apps using that component)
- `ux-regression` → priority signal; jump straight to the relevant lane regardless of selection algorithm

### Step 0e: Compact state (only when oversized)

```bash
[ $(wc -c < dev_docs/improve-backlog.md) -gt 100000 ] || [ $(wc -c < dev_docs/improve-log.md) -gt 100000 ] \
  && python scripts/improve_compact.py
```

See **State compaction** above. Skip silently when both files are under the threshold.

### Step 1: Pick a lane

If Step 0c already claimed this cycle for CI repair, or Step 0c2 claimed it for CodeQL repair, skip Step 1–2 (already handled).

If `$ARGUMENTS` forces a lane, skip to Step 2.

For each lane, compute two numbers from the unified backlog:

| Number | Method |
|--------|--------|
| `actionable_count(lane)` | Count rows in the lane's section with status ∈ {`REGRESSION`, `PENDING`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DRAFT`, or qa:`PENDING`} |
| `last_run_at(lane)` | Most recent `improve-log.md` entry for that lane that wasn't a housekeeping idle tick |

Selection priority:

1. **Any lane with REGRESSION rows** → that lane (most urgent backlog — shipped broken). Note: a red CI badge or CodeQL high/error already preempted this step via 0c / 0c2.
2. **Self-audit cadence**: if ≥15 cycles since the last `lane: self-audit` log entry (or none exists), run the self-audit strategy this cycle (playbook: `improve/strategies/self_audit.md` — adversarial review of recent `improve:` commits vs their log/backlog claims). Forceable via `/improve self-audit`.
3. **Capability-sweep cadence**: if ≥20 cycles since the last `lane: capability-sweep` log entry (or none exists), run a capability sweep this cycle — re-derive the inventory (`dazzle --help` + the MCP table in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` + the `.claude/skills`/`.claude/commands` tree) and reconcile `improve/capability-map.md`: flag any newly-built capability as `UNOWNED`, recompute `STALE` (last-exercised ≥20 cycles behind the current cycle). Forceable via `/improve capability-sweep`. `REGRESSION` + self-audit still preempt.
4. **Signal-biased pick**: if a `trial-friction` / `ux-component-shipped` / `ux-regression` signal is fresh, prefer the biased lane regardless of count
5. **Highest `actionable_count > 0`** → that lane; ties broken by oldest `last_run_at`
6. **TR-signal drain (autonomous-only).** If the trials backlog (`## Lane: trials`) has any **autonomous-actionable** TR row (see below), pick the owning lane for that row and run `improve/strategies/trial_signal_action.md` this cycle (log `picked {lane} for TR-N — {status}/{severity}`). Forceable via `/improve trial-signals`. Preempts pure capability re-stamps when product signal is sitting idle. Does **not** preempt REGRESSION / self-audit / capability-sweep / fresh signal bias.
7. **Explore phase, capability-coverage-directed.** Consult `improve/capability-map.md`. Recompute lag as `current_cycle − last-exercised` (treat map status `USED` with lag ≥20 as **STALE-effective**). Pick **one** capability in this order and hand the owning lane that specific exercise (log `picked {lane} to exercise {capability} — {reason}`):
   1. Any `UNOWNED` (strongest gap)
   2. Any `STALE` or STALE-effective, highest lag first
   3. Any `OWNED-IDLE` with `last-exercised = —` (never first-exercised), preferring **in-loop** owners over `(standalone)` when both exist; exercise playbook: `improve/strategies/owned_idle_exercise.md`
   4. Any `OWNED-IDLE` that has been exercised before but not for ≥20 cycles (treat like STALE)
   5. Else oldest `last_run_at` lane ordinary **explore phase**
8. **Explore budget at cap (100)** → housekeeping idle tick; log + release lock + exit. The log entry must name the two renewal routes so the loop never looks permanently stuck: the budget resets automatically on the next `dazzle-updated` release signal, or manually via `/improve --reset-budget`.

Record the choice. Bias from signals, TR-drain, or capability-coverage must be logged ("picked example-apps because of fresh ux-component-shipped from cycle N"; "picked hm-convergence to expand dual-locks — STALE 24 cycles"; "picked framework-ux for TR-50 OPEN_FRAMEWORK high") so future operators can audit.

### Autonomous TR eligibility (rule 6)

A TR row is **autonomous-actionable** when **all** of:

| Gate | Pass when |
|------|-----------|
| Status | ∈ {`OPEN`, `OPEN_FRAMEWORK`, `OPEN_DSL`, `FIXED-VERIFY`} — not `OPEN_UNKNOWN`, `NEEDS_REINFORCE`, `NOTED-POLLUTED`, `BLOCKED_ON→*`, praise-only |
| Severity | ∈ {`high`, `medium`} **or** status is `FIXED-VERIFY` (any severity — re-verify is cheap) |
| Clarity | Description names a concrete surface (URL, region, CLI flag, error string) **or** status is `FIXED-VERIFY` / already `→ #NNN` |
| No human fork | Fix does **not** require product/design intent (no tenancy/RBAC "what should we allow?" questions). If the only honest action is "ask the user", leave the row for a human session |

**Lane routing for TR rows:**

| Status / shape | Owning lane | Default action |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| `OPEN_FRAMEWORK` / filed `→ #N` | `framework-ux` (or `test-suite` if clearly test harness) | Reproduce → fix if local/clear → ship; else reinforce + leave filed |
| `OPEN_DSL` | `example-apps` | DSL/demo fix in the named app; validate+lint |
| `FIXED-VERIFY` | `trials` | Re-run the named scenario with `dazzle qa trial --fresh-db` (+ subscription driver); close or re-open |
| `OPEN` with clear bug + mechanism | best-fit lane | Same as OPEN_FRAMEWORK / OPEN_DSL by mechanism |

Skip (not autonomous): pure aesthetic/confusion without DOM/URL; same-trial contradictions (`NEEDS_REINFORCE`); anything that needs "author intent" (tenancy model, persona RBAC design). Full playbook: `improve/strategies/trial_signal_action.md`.

### Step 2: Hand off to lane

Read `improve/lanes/{name}.md` and follow its playbook end-to-end. The lane:

- Operates only on its own section of `improve-backlog.md`
- Returns an outcome: `{status: PASS|FAIL|BLOCKED|EXPLORED|HOUSEKEEPING, summary: str, signals_to_emit: list, budget_consumed: int}`
- Does **not** touch the lock, the preflight, the log, or other lanes' state

If the lane requires sub-strategy dispatch (framework-ux explore phase has 7: `missing_contracts`, `edge_cases`, `contract_audit`, `framework_gap_analysis`, `finding_investigation`, `api_surface_audit`, `quality_intelligence_sweep`; **hm-convergence** strategies — pick order when floors green: **`hyperpart_coherence`** drain if `python scripts/hm_coherence_queue.py --status` shows `queue>0` or PENDING `coherence_drain *` backlog rows, else **investigate** if `coherence.json` missing/stale (`improve/strategies/hyperpart_coherence.md`; force `/improve hm-convergence hyperpart_coherence [investigate|drain]`); **`gallery_probes`** — `python scripts/hm_gallery_probes.py --run` / `improve/strategies/gallery_probes.md`; **`dual_lock_expand`** — `python packages/hatchi-maxchi/tools/dual_lock_queue.py --top 5` / `improve/strategies/dual_lock_expand.md`; **`shadcn_parity`** — `python packages/hatchi-maxchi/tools/shadcn_parity.py --gaps-only` / `improve/strategies/shadcn_parity.md`), the lane reads from `improve/strategies/*.md` and picks one per its own rules.

### Step 3: Apply outcome

1. **Increment explore budget** by `outcome.budget_consumed`
2. **Append log entry** to `improve-log.md`:
   ```
   ## Cycle N — YYYY-MM-DD — lane: {name} — outcome: {status}
   {outcome.summary}
   ```
3. **Emit signals**:
   ```python
   from dazzle.cli.runtime_impl.ux_cycle_signals import emit
   for sig in outcome.signals_to_emit:
       emit(source="improve", kind=sig.kind, payload=sig.payload)
   ```
4. **Mark run**:
   ```python
   from dazzle.cli.runtime_impl.ux_cycle_signals import mark_run
   mark_run(source="improve")
   ```
5. **Stamp capability coverage**: in `improve/capability-map.md`, set `last-exercised = N`
   for every capability the cycle actually invoked (the lane reports which), flip its
   status toward `USED`, and recompute `STALE` (owned + `last-exercised` ≥20 cycles
   behind N). This is the maintenance half of the capability-coverage rule — it keeps
   the registry an honest picture of what the loop is really exercising. The commit in
   step 6 includes `capability-map.md` when it changed.
6. **Commit** if the lane modified tracked files (the lane's playbook reports this). Use message format: `improve: cycle N {lane} — {summary}`

### Step 4: Release lock

```bash
rm -f .dazzle/improve.lock
```

### Step 5: Report

One-paragraph summary: lane chosen, outcome, what changed, budget remaining, next-cycle hint (which lane is likely next based on current backlog state).

### Step 6: Self-schedule (mandatory — keep the chain alive)

After Step 5 text is ready (lock already released). Port of CyFuture's one-shot
self-chain: each cycle arms the **next** fire rather than relying on a fixed
`/loop` ticker or a `recurring: true` improve job.

#### 6a. Decide

```bash
uv run python scripts/improve_schedule_next.py --result PASS
# or: --result FAIL
#     --deployed 1          # this cycle pushed code
#     --ci auto|green|red|in_progress|unavailable   # default auto via `gh`
#     --stop
```

JSON stdout is also written to `.dazzle/improve-schedule-state.json` (gitignored).
The script **probes main CI** (`gh run list --workflow ci.yml --branch main`) unless
`--ci` is set — do not invent a fixed 15–20m wait after every push.

#### 6b. Act

| `action` | What to do |
|----------|------------|
| `schedule` | Call **`scheduler_create`** with **all** fields from `scheduler_create` in the JSON (`interval`, `prompt`, `recurring`, **`fire_immediately`**, `durable`). Honor `fire_immediately: true` when present (CI green / repair / regression). |
| `stop` | Do **not** schedule. Note stop reason in the cycle log line below |

#### 6c. Log the chain

Append to this cycle's `improve-log.md` entry (or a trailing line):

```
**Next:** schedule {interval} fire_immediately={bool} job_id={id} reason={reason} ci={status}
# or: **Next:** STOP reason={reason}
```

#### Opportunistic intervals (encoded in the script)

Not a fixed ticker. Heat + **main CI badge** choose the delay:

| Situation | Interval | `fire_immediately` |
|-----------|----------|--------------------|
| REGRESSION rows | `2m` | yes |
| CI **green** + work remains (esp. after `--deployed 1`) | `2m` | **yes** |
| CI **red** (repair soon) | `2m` | yes |
| CI **in_progress** after deploy | `3m` poll | no |
| Actionable / explore budget / self-audit or sweep due | `5m` | no |
| Cycle failed | `10m` | no |
| Explore at cap + no actionable + cadences not due | `2h` | no |
| Human/framework escalate (`--stop`) | — | — |

**Intent:** after a push, re-arm a short **CI poll** while the badge is yellow; when
CI turns green, the next one-shot should fire ASAP so product explore is not
blocked by a 20m settle timer.
#### Overlap hygiene

- Prefer **one** pending `/improve` one-shot at a time.
- Do **not** `scheduler_create(..., recurring=true)` for the main chain.
- If `scheduler_list` shows multiple competing `/improve` one-shots, delete extras and keep one.

#### Dead-man's switch (ops)

A **daily** durable recurring task should remain armed (create once if missing):

- Interval: `1d`, `recurring: true`, `durable: true`, `fire_immediately: false`
- Prompt: contents of `scripts/improve_watchdog_prompt.md`
- Purpose: if the self-chain dies (crash before Step 6, 7-day durable expiry), re-arm a one-shot

If no daily improve watchdog exists when you finish REPORT, create it once from that file.

`--status` and `--reset-budget` modes **skip** Step 6 (no cycle → no chain advance).

## Cross-lane signal contract

| Kind | Emitted by | Consumed by |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `ux-component-shipped` | framework-ux | example-apps (re-verify), ux-converge (refresh contracts) |
| `ux-regression` | framework-ux | driver (priority pick) |
| `trial-friction` | trials / trial_signal_action | framework-ux (consider contract), driver (lane bias + rule 6 TR drain) |
| `gap-doc-written` | framework-ux | driver (informational; logged) |
| `app-fixed` | example-apps | framework-ux (re-walk if contract relates), trials (re-trial scenarios) |
| `convergence-clean` | ux-converge | example-apps (clear stale rows for that app) |
| `dazzle-updated` | (external — releases) | all lanes (mark affected rows) |
| `fix-deployed` | (external — /issues, /ship) | all lanes (mark affected rows) |

Lanes declare which kinds they emit and consume in their own files. Driver wires the consumption side.

## Hard rules

- **One lane per cycle.** Don't chain across lanes — the next /improve invocation handles that. Exception: Step 0c CI repair **is** the cycle (no second lane after a red-badge fix attempt).
- **Lock is mandatory.** No cycle without `.dazzle/improve.lock` held.
- **Always preflight.** Even for lanes whose strict checks don't seem relevant — preflight is the floor.
- **Always CI snapshot.** Step 0c every cycle; red completed badge → repair cycle, not explore.
- **Commit every cycle that modifies tracked files.** Even failure cycles commit if they updated notes.
- **Explore budget is global.** A lane's explore phase always increments the shared counter. CI repair does not consume explore budget.
- **Self-schedule every full cycle.** Step 6 is mandatory after REPORT (except `--status` / `--reset-budget`). Use one-shots only; never `recurring: true` for the main chain.

## Status mode

When invoked with `--status`, skip the cycle and emit:

```
## /improve status — YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

Budget: X/100
Lock: free | held by PID since TIME
CI badge (main): green | red (run #id) | in_progress | unavailable
Last cycle: N — lane: {name} — outcome: {status}

Lane:           Actionable    Last run     Likely next?
framework-ux    N             cycle M      yes/no
example-apps    N             cycle M      yes/no
trials          N             cycle M      yes/no
ux-converge     N             cycle M      yes/no
test-suite      N             cycle M      yes/no

Recent signals (last 24h):
- {kind} from {source} at TIME
```

Read-only — does not modify state, log, or lock. Status mode **does** run the cheap `gh` CI snapshot so the badge line is live.

## Usage

```bash
/improve                                # one cycle + self-schedule next one-shot
/improve framework-ux                   # force a lane
/improve framework-ux contract_audit    # force lane + sub-strategy
/improve cimonitor                      # force CI snapshot (+ repair if red)
/improve --status                       # status report, no cycle (no schedule)
/improve --reset-budget                 # clear explore cap (no cycle)
# Prefer self-schedule (Step 6) over a fixed ticker. Alternatives:
#   /loop 6m /improve                   # session-bound fixed interval
# Daily dead-man: scripts/improve_watchdog_prompt.md (durable recurring 1d)
```

## Consolidation status

Consolidation is **complete**: the old /ux-cycle, /trial-cycle, /ux-converge, and standalone /improve skills have been removed; their playbook bodies now live in `improve/lanes/*.md`. `/improve` is the single entrypoint for all four lanes.

See `dev_docs/2026-04-25-improve-consolidation-design.md` for the rationale.
