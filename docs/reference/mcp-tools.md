# MCP Tool Inventory

> **Auto-generated** from knowledge base TOML files by `docs_gen.py`.
> Do not edit manually; run `dazzle docs generate` to regenerate.

Live inventory of the MCP tools exposed by `dazzle mcp run`. Generated from the tool registry — every operation, parameter, and description below comes straight from `dazzle.mcp.server.tools_consolidated.get_all_consolidated_tools()` at build time. Run `dazzle docs generate` to refresh after adding, renaming, or removing tools or operations. The drift gate at `tests/unit/test_api_surface_drift.py` (mcp_tools baseline) catches surface changes that didn't update the docs.

**Live count:** 37 tools, 168 operations. Regenerated from the registry every time `dazzle docs generate` runs.

Each tool is a single MCP entry point that dispatches on the `operation` argument. The Bootstrap tool (`bootstrap`) is the exception — it takes free-form spec text, not an operation enum, and is the canonical entry point for "build me an app" requests.

## Per-tool detail

### `agent`

Agent closed-loop control plane (#1605): context (brownfield map + runtime.truth + next_steps), prove (static binding evidence), playbook (domain_logic map→bind→scaffold→prove). Does NOT write files — use CLI `dazzle scaffold` / `dazzle prove`. For data-shape judgement (exclusive FKs / poly_ref / JSONB) use the `representation` tool (#1617).

**Operations (3):** `context`, `prove`, `playbook`

**Parameters:**

- `story_id` *(string)* — Story id for prove (optional; default all accepted)
- `name` *(string)* — Playbook name (default: domain_logic)
- `project_path` *(string)* — Optional: Absolute path to project directory. If omitted, uses active project.

**Operations (3):** `list`, `get`, `check_updates`

**Parameters:**

- `project_path` *(string)* — Optional: Absolute path to project directory. If omitted, uses active project.
- `command` *(string)* — Command name (for 'get' operation)
- `commands_version` *(string)* — Local commands_version from .manifest.json (for 'check_updates')

---

### `api_pack`

API pack operations: list, search, get. Project-local packs in .dazzle/api_packs/ override built-in packs.

---

### `bootstrap`

Entry point for 'build me an app' requests. Scans for spec files, runs cognition pass, and returns a mission briefing with agent instructions. Call this first when a user wants to build an app. Returns structured guidance for the next steps: either questions to ask the user, or instructions for DSL generation. The workflow includes mandatory RBAC: every entity must have permit:/forbid: access rules, verified via policy(operation='access_matrix') before the app is considered complete.

**Parameters:**

- `spec_text` *(string)* — Optional: spec text if provided directly by user
- `spec_path` *(string)* — Optional: path to spec file

### `composition`

Composition analysis: audit (DOM-level visual hierarchy audit), capture (Playwright section-level screenshots), analyze (LLM visual evaluation of captured screenshots), report (combined audit+capture+analyze with merged scoring), bootstrap (generate synthetic reference library for few-shot evaluation). Audit computes attention weights using a 5-factor model and evaluates composition rules. Capture takes section-level screenshots from a running app. Analyze uses Claude vision to evaluate screenshots for rendering fidelity, icon/media issues, color consistency, layout overflow, visual hierarchy, and responsive fidelity. Report runs audit (always) + visual pipeline (when base_url given) and merges into a combined score. Bootstrap generates synthetic reference images for few-shot visual evaluation prompts. Inspect_styles extracts computed CSS styles via Playwright getComputedStyle() for agent-driven layout diagnosis (zero LLM tokens).

**Operations (6):** `audit`, `capture`, `analyze`, `report`, `bootstrap`, `inspect_styles`

**Parameters:**

- `base_url` *(string)* — Server URL (required for capture, e.g. http://localhost:3000)

- `level` *(string)* — Filter by level (for logs)
- `errors_only` *(boolean)* — Show only errors (for logs)
- `tool_name` *(string)* — Filter by tool name (for telemetry)
- `since_minutes` *(integer)* — Only show invocations from the last N minutes (for telemetry)
- `stats_only` *(boolean)* — Only return aggregate stats, no individual invocations (for telemetry)
- `cursor_seq` *(integer)* — Sequence number to read after (for activity, 0 = from start)
- `cursor_epoch` *(integer)* — Epoch counter for staleness detection (for activity, 0 = initial)
- `format` *(string)* — Response format (for activity): 'structured' (JSON, default) or 'formatted' (human-readable text)
- `project_path` *(string)* — Optional: Absolute path to project directory. If omitted, uses active project.

### `story`

Story operations: get, composition, coverage, scope_fidelity. Use get with view='wall' for a founder-friendly board grouped by implementation status (working/needs polish/not started). composition maps the story⇄rhythm graph — which phase composes a story (and whether it is active), and which stories are declared but composed into no journey. scope_fidelity checks that implementing processes exercise all entities in story scope.

**Operations (4):** `get`, `composition`, `coverage`, `scope_fidelity`

**Parameters:**

- `status_filter` *(string)* — Filter by status (for get)
- `story_ids` *(array)* — Story IDs (for get: fetch full details; for composition: focus on these stories)
- `view` *(string)* — View mode for get operation. 'wall' groups stories by implementation status (working/needs polish/not started)
- `persona` *(string)* — Filter stories by persona/actor name (for get with view=wall)
- `project_path` *(string)* — Optional: Absolute path to project directory. If omitted, uses active project.

### `test_design`

Test design operations: get, gaps. Query test designs and identify coverage gaps.

**Operations (2):** `get`, `gaps`

**Parameters:**

- `status_filter` *(string)* — Filter by status (for get)
- `test_ids` *(array)* — Test design IDs to fetch full details (for get)
- `project_path` *(string)* — Optional: Absolute path to project directory. If omitted, uses active project.

### `test_intelligence`

Query persisted test result history. Operations: summary (recent runs overview), failures (failure patterns, flaky tests, persistent failures), regression (tests that went pass→fail between last two runs), coverage (success rate trend across recent runs), context (single-call AI-ready snapshot combining all above), journey (most recent E2E journey analysis). Results are automatically persisted by dsl_test run_all.

**Operations (6):** `summary`, `failures`, `regression`, `coverage`, `context`, `journey`

**Parameters:**

- `limit` *(integer)* — Number of recent runs to analyze (default: 10)
- `run_id` *(string)* — Specific run ID to query test cases for
- `failure_type` *(string)* — Filter by failure type (for failures)
- `category` *(string)* — Filter by test category (for failures)
- `project_path` *(string)* — Optional: Absolute path to project directory. If omitted, uses active project.

### `user_management`

User management operations: list, create, get, update, reset_password, deactivate, list_sessions, revoke_session, config. Manage auth users and sessions in PostgreSQL.

**Operations (9):** `list`, `create`, `get`, `update`, `reset_password`, `deactivate`, `list_sessions`, `revoke_session`, `config`

**Parameters:**

- `email` *(string)* — User email (for create, get)
- `user_id` *(string)* — User UUID (for get, update, reset_password, deactivate, list_sessions)
- `name` *(string)* — Display name (for create)
- `username` *(string)* — New display name (for update)
- `roles` *(array)* — Role names (for create, update)
- `role` *(string)* — Filter by role (for list)
- `is_superuser` *(boolean)* — Superuser flag (for create, update)
- `is_active` *(boolean)* — Active status (for update)
- `active_only` *(boolean)* — Only active users/sessions (for list, list_sessions; default: true)
- `password` *(string)* — Explicit password (for create, reset_password). If omitted, a random password is generated.
- `session_id` *(string)* — Session ID (for revoke_session)
- `limit` *(integer)* — Max results (for list, list_sessions; default: 50)
- `offset` *(integer)* — Pagination offset (for list; default: 0)
- `project_path` *(string)* — Optional: Absolute path to project directory. If omitted, uses active project.

### `user_profile`

User profile for adaptive persona inference. Operations: observe (analyze recent tool invocations), observe_message (analyze user message vocabulary), get (return current profile context), reset (delete and return fresh default).

**Operations (4):** `observe`, `observe_message`, `get`, `reset`

**Parameters:**

- `message_text` *(string)* — User message text (for observe_message)
- `limit` *(integer)* — Max invocations to analyze (for observe; default: 50)
