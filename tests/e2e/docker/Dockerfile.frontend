# DEPRECATED: This Dockerfile is no longer used.
#
# The Dazzle runtime now serves both frontend (HTMX/server-rendered) and backend
# from a single container. Use Dockerfile.e2e instead.
#
# This file is kept for reference only and will be removed in a future version.
#
# Historical context:
# This was for a Vite-based frontend that has been replaced by HTMX templates.
# The dazzle_dnr_ui module no longer exists.
