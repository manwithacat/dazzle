"""Regression gates for sitespec title + heading fixes.

- **#1107** — ``PageContext.app_name`` lookup probes ``product_name``
  (the actual field on ``SitePageContext``) before falling back to
  ``app_name``/``"Dazzle"``. Without the probe, every sitespec page
  title rendered as ``"<page> — Dazzle"`` regardless of the product
  name set in the spec.

- **#1108** — pages without a ``type: hero`` section auto-inject an
  ``<h1>`` from ``page.title``. Pages that DO have a hero stay
  untouched (hero owns the h1 already, and a second one would
  violate the single-h1 WCAG rule).

The fixes live in
``src/dazzle/back/runtime/site_routes.py::_render_site_inner_html``
and the surrounding ``PageContext`` build site, both inside the
``build_pages_router`` closure. The cleanest test is a content gate
on the source — the refactor to expose the function as module-level
is intentionally not in scope here.
