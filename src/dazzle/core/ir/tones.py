"""Canonical semantic-tone vocabulary for status badges (#1493).

The single source of truth for the tone palette an enum value's ``semantic:``
clause may bind to. Lives in ``core`` (not ``render``) because the validator
(``core.validation``) must check declared tones against it, and ``core`` is the
bottom layer — ``render``/``page`` may import *up* from here, never the reverse.

The five tones are exactly those with CSS rules (``badge.css``) and entries in
the render-layer name-guess map (``_STATUS_TONE_MAP``). ``positive`` is accepted
as a DSL-author-friendly alias for ``success`` (the issue body proposed
``positive``; the live stylesheet only has ``success``), so a declared
``done=positive`` normalises to ``success`` at parse/validate/render time.
